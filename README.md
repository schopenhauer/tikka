# tikka

Tikka is a plain-vanilla [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) web frontend, which lets you upload, download and analyse a variety of documents. The app is ready to be deployed on [Heroku](https://chicken-tikka.herokuapp.com)-ready and works out of the box with Python [3.10](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html).

## Usage

First, install the necessary Python packages.

```sh
pip install --user virtualenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, activate a virtual environment and start the Flask web frontend running on port 5000 (by default).

```sh
source env/bin/activate
flask run
```

## Getting hungry?

Yes, me too.
